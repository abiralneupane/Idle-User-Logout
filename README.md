# Idle-User-Logout
This plugin detects idle user and execute the action that is being specified in Admin End.

From version 2.0, you can now specify the action and time for each user role.

It tracks the users activity in both the front end and admin end.

You can setup Idle Time from WP Admin > Settings > Idle User Logout

Once you reach Idle User Logout Page, you can setup behavior of the plugin for each user\'s role.

The plugin also checks from server end. So even if the user closes the browser, the timer goes on. And if the timer exceeds, it will execute the actions defined in admin end ( still in beta ).

If there is any problem, or need any help, we can give you a helping hand.
